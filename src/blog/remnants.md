<p>This September I launched Cloud Shelter, a project which I have been working on daily for a few years at this point. Cloud Shelter has gone through many many transformations, from being an app built in Unity which could be downloaded like a game and visited, to now an online virtual experience using various JavaScript libraries. But finally at long last today (17.12.2022) at 18:00 I will be launching Cloud Shelter's long awaited first show, Remnants!</p>

<br>

<p>Remnants is a group show featuring 8 amazing artists that I am thrilled to be working with: Alex Pearl, Christoph Jones, Molly Erin McCarthy, Speculative Geologies by Jason Urban and Leslie Mutchler, Leifang by Phoebe Bray and Katharine Platts, and myself. The show will feature everthing from dancing video collages, video essays, interactive singing organisms; ruins, structures and folklore, spinning techno minerals and disintegrating landscapes.</p>

<br>
