<p class="indent">In 2022 I built and launched <a href="https://app.bralri.net/build-a-vessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build-A-Vessel</a>, an online project which experimented with user input to use spliced digital sculptures as "building blocks" to create their own vessels. Akin to the idea of "Build-A-Bear", each itteration and end result is unique. Users are able to refresh the page to load the blocks in new orientations and positions, and once they have completed building their Vessels they are able to download the Vessels as a .glb model.</p>
