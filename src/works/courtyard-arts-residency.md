<blockquote>
<p>"what do we call these relics?</p>
<p>do they have names? Or are they just things?</p>
<p>things that did a thing?</p>
<p>things that will do a thing?</p>
<p>things that do nothing?</p>
<p>things that do everything?</p>
<p>useless to us, what are they?</p>
<p>what will they be use for?</p>
<p>when will they be used?</p>
<p>who uses them?</p>
<p>they almost look like they do something, right?</p>
<p>things of remembrance,</p>
<p>things of optimism,</p>
<p>things of pessimism,</p>
<p>things of opportunity,</p>
<p>things of the past,</p>
<p>things of the future & things of the present,</p>
<p>things of the never-will & always."</p>
