<blockquote>
<p>"Where are we now, now Jennifer is in Paradise? *</p>

<br>

<p>Featuring writing from Owen Ramsay and work from multidisciplinary artists Gwen SenHui Chen, Alexandros Argyros Amerikanos and Bryan Ridpath.</p>

<br>

<p class="indent">The show features playful enquires into futurities, feelings about our rapidly changing digital age, our sense of place and its erosion in time. An exploration and findings of what might become our (future) relics, with the birth of a new everyday in a defunct reality."</p>
